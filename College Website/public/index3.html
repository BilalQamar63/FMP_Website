            ACADEMY has been acclaimed as a leading educational research and education consulting
            companyWe’re a leading research university with a heart. Founded in the decade
            that the U.S. Constitution was signed, we’re the nation’s oldest
            Catholic and Jesuit university. We’re a community of people who bridge
            our disparate experiences and identities. Meet the people and
            places that make Eduford home.. A CBSE school affiliation is a crucial
            step forward in the growth of a school. The school's expansion is often hampered by a lack

            this procedure so that you can concentrate on other vital responsibilities. Our team of highly
            skilled professionals work around the clock to make your vision a reality. We provide
            plenty of Class room procedures for interactive and experiential learning in addition
            to solutions and support to teachers and students in the teaching learning process.

            of standards and effective school management. We conduct Model Examination, Unit test
            and Result improvement test series in CBSE schools to improve the confidence of
            students through practice .We also publish Teachers Manuals, Registers and Question
            banks . Our question papers have helped the students
